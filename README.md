## Monitoring and Analytics

### Performance Metrics

- Lead enrichment success rate ~ 80%
- Email generation speed ~ 20-30 seconds per personalized campaign
- API usage tracking 10$ for 1000 leads at gpt-4-turbo pricing, much cheaper now
- Error rates ~ Somewhat high, but that has to mostly do with website protection, I recommend setting up proxies

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### MongoDB Connection

mongosh --eval "db.adminCommand('ping')"

# Rate limit settings in base.py

RATE_LIMIT = 60  # requests per minute

## Performance Optimization

### Batch Processing

- Optimal batch size: 10-50 leads
- Concurrent enrichment: 5 threads
- Rate limiting: 1 request/second

Feel free to use this for your lead generation needs. You might need to update the instantly apis to enable more recent functionality. I recommend using Wiza lists/apollo data. Good Luck!
