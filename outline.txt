This is the outline of the system/my night notes

We need to be able to select the accounts associated and hence store them somewhere
each email needs a db entry with the client name/clientId for use as well as status

need an agent that creates templates and views analytics we will call him the ITERATOR

need an agent that evaluates email performance per account the TERMINATOR
(if they are not delivering needs to have the ability to flag the account)

Scraping should provide more distinct data rather than a generic sumary + ICP+ Offer

As later scraping will be multiplatform need to brainstorm automation pathways, botasaurus seems like a good option

big steps that remain:

1. Email creator and automatic splitting to different version of the emails. 
2. Follow up writer (need not be custom for now)
3. the above need to be saved in the db

Instantly integration:
Create campaign
    Assign leads to it 
    Assign sender emails to it
    Assign campaign to it
    Save campaign information in the db 

Iterate campaign
    Work on the analytics for the campaign over time and see 
    the results and see which emails (templates) performed and how

Status updates
    send daily updates to whoever owns the campaigns with analytics.
